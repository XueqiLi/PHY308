%This code exemplifies some basic programming structures like if statements
%and for loops by going through the excersize of constructing an array
%representing a piecewise continous triangular function.

t = linspace(0,1);

f = zeros(1,length(t)); % initialize the array outside of the loop because 
                        % resizing arrays is slow and you don't want to do
                        % this every iteration of the loop.

%The for loop below steps through t element by element to construct a
%triangular function. The cusp occurs at t= 0.5 where the functional form
%shifts.
                        
for j = 1:length(t); %a for loop with length(t) steps.                        
                     %j is the loop counter and increments by 1 each
                     %iteration.
    
    if t(j) <0.5     %if the jth element of t is less than 0.5
        f(j) = t(j);  % assign the jth value of f to the jth value of t
    
    
    else             %otherwise....  
        f(j) = -(t(j)-1); %asign the jth value of f a different value of t
    end % end if statement
end %end for loop
